# Online-Shopping
A project largely has to deal with the creation followed by the subsequent usage of a relatively small – scaled Web Page Portal to be used for the purpose of Online Shopping for E-Commerce related concurrent transactions by the users (akin to a minor scaled version of giants such as Amazon / Flipkart etc.)


We have divided our entire project into 2 major parts – the Front-End and the Back-End portions respectively.
The Front-End portion involves the usage of HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language) for designing the structure (format) of our webpage and then CSS (Cascaded Style Sheets) for giving a proper design and definition to the HTML structure to make it appear more appealing and authentic / convincing to the user traffic on our page. Whereas the Back-End portion deals with the usage of creating a MySQL database relational schema on the PHPMyAdmin server using Xampp and having relations for the new user login, sign up, the customer_order details, the cart details, product_category details, product_brand details as well as the final checkout and payment_mode details.

In order to achieve the aforementioned and also to facilitate the dynamic usage of products / items selection and their addition or removal from the users shopping cart, we have also introduced a mixture of static as well as dynamic links triggered by the GET protocol used for the purpose of submission of targets.

Also, PHP language was made use of for all the Back-End database handling and SQL query manipulation on the server side to incorporate the dynamic links during the runtime itself.
